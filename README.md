## 🧪 Lab Challenges and Writeups/Blog

### 🧱 Pyramid of Pain – TryHackMe

**Room Difficulty:** Easy
**Focus:** Threat Intelligence, Detection Engineering

**🔍 Summary:**
This room explores the *Pyramid of Pain* concept, which illustrates how difficult it is for adversaries to change different types of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). The lab emphasizes the importance of focusing on high-value indicators like TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) instead of easily modified ones like hashes or IPs.

**🛠 Techniques Explored:**

* Hashes vs TTPs in detection
* MITRE ATT\&CK usage
* Strategic threat hunting using behavioral indicators

**📌 Key Takeaways:**

* Detection should focus on behaviors, not artifacts.
* The higher you go on the pyramid, the more disruptive your detection is to the attacker.
* Prioritizing TTPs enhances long-term defense capabilities.

### 🎣 Phishing Emails in Action – TryHackMe

**Room Difficulty:** Easy
**Focus:** Email Security, Threat Analysis

**🔍 Summary:**
This room walks through a hands-on case of a phishing attack. You analyze an email's header, body, and attachments to identify signs of compromise, and simulate the process a SOC analyst might go through to report and block such an attempt.

**🔧 Tools Used:**

* VirusTotal
* MxToolbox
* CyberChef
* Email header analyzers

**📌 Key Takeaways:**

* Always inspect email headers for authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) failures.
* Malicious emails often impersonate trusted brands or IT departments.
* Sandbox and static analysis are essential for safe malware inspection.

### 🔴 Red Team Threat Intel – TryHackMe

**Room Difficulty:** Medium
**Focus:** Adversary Emulation, Threat Actor Profiling

**🔍 Summary:**
This room focuses on using publicly available threat intelligence to replicate adversary behaviors during red team engagements. You'll learn to build campaigns modeled after real-world groups using frameworks like MITRE ATT\&CK.

**🧰 Techniques Explored:**

* ATT\&CK Navigator for tactic mapping
* Using OSINT to gather threat actor data
* Mapping APT group behaviors to attack simulations

**📌 Key Takeaways:**

* Red teaming is most effective when based on real threat intelligence.
* Understanding adversary TTPs helps craft more realistic engagements.
* The MITRE ATT\&CK framework is a central tool for both offense and defense.
